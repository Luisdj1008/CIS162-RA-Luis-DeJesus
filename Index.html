<p>I love to push forward and learn new skills. I really enjoy playing guitar and recording music in my home studio.
    Something that I truly enjoy about this class is that it challenges me to broaden y horizons on what I am capable of doing.
    My favorite kind of of food is Seafood. Seafood and beer is the best way to celebrate the weekend.
    I enjoy going out with people my age or older. Theres more stuff top talk about usually.
    I have a Pitbull for a dog. His name is Tyson.
